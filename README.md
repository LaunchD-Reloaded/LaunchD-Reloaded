The **LaunchD-Reloaded™** project is an independent reimplementation of the
Apple LaunchD Bootstrap Service principally for Airyx OS, but also compatible
with other free-software BSDs and GNU+Linux. Also implemented is some extra
functionality absent from Apple LaunchD, and subsets of modules ancillary to
LaunchD, like libXPC, shimmed atop Red Hat Corporation's industry-standard
D-Bus™ message-oriented middleware framework.


### Licencing

LaunchD-Reloaded is free and open source software.
