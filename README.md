The **LaunchD-Reloaded™** project is an independent reimplementation of the
Apple LaunchD Bootstrap Service for free-software BSDs and GNU+Linux, with extra
functionality. Also implemented are subsets of modules ancillary to LaunchD,
like libXPC, shimmed atop Red Hat Corporation's industry-standard D-Bus™
message-oriented middleware framework.
